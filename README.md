# CommentReactJSMVC
This project helps to make React components.

Bootstrap has been also used here a little bit.

You need to install node.exe to install npm packages.

The project has been made using gulp and browserify.

The node_modules folder is a set of packages those are installed using the following two commands in the base CommentReactJSMVC folder:

    $ npm install --save-dev gulp;
    
    $ npm install --save-dev react browserify reactify vinyl-source-stream;

Finally to build the program you need to do the command:

    gulp;

And run it in VS.
